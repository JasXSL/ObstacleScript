Supportcube implemented. Add its functions to Rlv.lsl. Todo exists in there

First challenge:
	- Reaching max arousal kicks the player off the current obstacle.

Obstacles:
	- Shimmying wall: Has waterspouts beneath it that turn on in a fixed pattern. Getting hit by one locks you for a few seconds and increases arousal.
	- Tumbling beam: Tap left/right to keep a bar in the middle to keep from falling off as you slide across.
	- Pusher walls: Pushes back/forth at specific intervals.
	- Tentacle trap: Grabs a player when they get close to it.
	
Obstacles (later):
	- Hitting a button near shimmying wall immediately activates all spouts.
	- Hitting a button near the slide beam stuns for a while and increases arousal.
	- Hitting a button activates ALL slider walls.
